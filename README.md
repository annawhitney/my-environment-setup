# my-environment-setup
An easy way for me to get my .vimrc/.bashrc/etc everywhere I need them.

## Setup notes-to-self:
- concatenate .profile onto existing .profile or .bash\_profile
- separate setup required for [The Fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
- Pathogen requires .vim directory contents as well as .vimrc - DOUBLE CHECK WHAT'S ALREADY THERE ON ANY NEW SYSTEM
