# my-environment-setup
An easy way for me to get my .vimrc/.bashrc/etc everywhere I need them.

## Setup notes-to-self:
- don't blindly replace existing files on a new system; check contents and/or concatenate onto existing file
- separate setup required for [The Fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
